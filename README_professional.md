## Project Overview

**Searchr — Instroid Edition** serves as a UI concept for mobile environments, drawing inspiration from Android launchers and curated app stores. It is built for **demonstration, branding, and client presentations**, showcasing attention to visual hierarchy, typography, and digital product aesthetics.

The primary goal is to illustrate how high-performance frontend systems can simulate native mobile interfaces using only static web technologies.

---

## Core Features

- Custom-designed **App Launcher Interface**
- Modular **page layouts**: `home`, `app store`, `detail view`
- Local-first development: no external CDN or API dependency
- Offline-ready with embedded fonts and assets
- Stylized app previews with hover states and animated containers
- JSON-based mock data integration for app content simulation
- Pixel-optimized UI with modern typographic hierarchy

---

## Design & Architecture

The layout uses modern, semantic HTML5 and layered CSS for visual structure and brand consistency. Fonts like Google Sans and Roboto are embedded for native-like rendering across devices.

**Design Principles Applied:**

- **Clarity:** Clean separation of content and style
- **Consistency:** Reusable components and naming conventions
- **Brand Identity:** Visual alignment with the Searchr aesthetic
- **Responsiveness:** Optimized for mid-screen sizes and mock mobile views

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Markup:** HTML5
- **Styling:** Pure CSS3 (no frameworks used)
- **Data Layer:** Local JSON files
- **Assets:** Self-hosted fonts, SVGs, PNGs
- **Rendering:** Client-side only, no JavaScript frameworks
